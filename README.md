## THIS PROJECT IS UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT. The project is not  yet ready for public use, as breaking updates and refactoring are quite a common happening at this stage.

The **Demido Shell** serves as the core component of the **Demido** project, providing a unified and efficient interface
for managing and interacting with Demido services. It is designed to streamline the process of running, monitoring, and
controlling various platform bots from a single, cohesive environment.

This shell allows to easily initiate and manage services, ensuring seamless communication and operation between
different services and platform bots. Its intuitive architecture simplifies complex tasks, making it accessible for
developers and system administrators alike.

The Demido Shell is the backbone of the Demido ecosystem, ensuring that all components work together in harmony,
empowering us to focus on our development goals without worrying about underlying complexities.
